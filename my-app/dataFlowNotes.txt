WeatherCard (renders data)

caching: 
First time: /api/weather?q=Berlin → cached as ["weather", "Berlin"]
Second time: instantly returns cached Berlin data
-------------------------------

You type “Paris” → stored in React state city.

You click Get Weather → triggers handleSearch().

handleSearch() calls refetch() from TanStack Query.

refetch() runs your queryFn → that’s getWeather(city).

getWeather(city) calls your Next.js API route → /api/weather?q=Paris.

The API route (route.js) fetches data from OpenWeather, keeps your API key secret, and sends the weather JSON back to the frontend.

React Query caches that data (key: ["weather", "Paris"]) and reuses it next time you search “Paris.”

WeatherCard renders the fetched data beautifully with MUI.
